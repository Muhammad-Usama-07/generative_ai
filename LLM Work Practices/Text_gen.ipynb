      "on your lap to make them feel more comfortable and familiar with the clothes. \n",

      "dogs or cats to wear pet clothes are:  \n",
      "1. Wearing animal clothing is prohibited as a form of coercion.  \n",
      "Because if you force your dog or cat to wear clothes unwillingly, it will cause \n",
      "stress and distrust in us to put on clothes for them. Therefore, you should do it \n",
      "gradually and follow the advice above so that they can happily wear dog \n",
      "clothes and cat clothes. \n",
      "2. During training, you must be calm. Do not shout or yell loudly. \n",
      "In addition to forcing your dog or cat to wear clothes, another thing to watch \n",
      "out for that will cause stress is yelling, scolding, or yelling loudly at your dog \n",
      "or cat, which will cause more shock and eventually make them afraid of \n",
      "wearing clothes. \n",
      "3. Do not force your dog or cat to wear tight and uncomfortable clothes. \n",
      "For the last important prohibition that beginners who are training their dogs or \n",
